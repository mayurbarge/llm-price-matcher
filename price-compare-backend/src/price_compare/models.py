"""The shape a product listing gets normalized into, regardless of platform.

`brand` and `simple_name` exist purely to make cross-platform matching
precise (see matcher.py). Comparing whole product titles -- "Dove Cream
Beauty Bathing Bar" against "Dove Cream Beauty Bar Soap" -- is noisy even
before accounting for genuine vocabulary differences ("besan" vs "gram
flour", "curd" vs "dahi") that plain string similarity can't bridge at
all, since there's no shared substring for it to find.

`simple_name` asks the extraction LLM to canonicalize rather than copy:
use standard, everyday grocery terminology instead of the page's exact
wording. Blinkit's and Zepto's extractions are two independent LLM calls
that never see each other's output, so this can't guarantee identical
strings -- but a model's own world knowledge tends to converge on similar
plain wording for the same real product even without coordination, which
is what makes the fuzzy comparison in matcher.py actually work well. This
costs nothing extra: it's the same one call per platform that already
extracts `name`/`price`/etc., just better instructions on that same call.
